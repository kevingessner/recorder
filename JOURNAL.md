# Recorder

## 2022-06-15

Recorder is an app for leaving voice messages IRL.
Running on a mounted mobile device, you can record a message that will be stored locally.
Play it at the push of a button, with a clear sign when a new message is available.

Implemented as a single-page web app.
Can record a message from the local mic and replay it over speakers.
No persistence yet; Play button is a noop.
